# Doubly Linked List Generated by IA Tools

This project contains a Java implementation of a **Doubly Linked List**, generated with the help of AI tools. It demonstrates basic data structure manipulation using Java, including adding, removing, and traversing nodes in both directions.

## 📦 Project Structure

├── .idea/                      # IntelliJ project settings
├── out/                        # Compiled class files
├── src/                        # Source code
│   └── Main.java               # Main class demonstrating usage of the doubly linked list
├── DoubleLinkedList.iml       # IntelliJ module file
└── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Features

- Add elements to the front or end of the list
- Remove elements from the front or end
- Print the list in forward or reverse order
- Simple, clean, and easy-to-understand implementation
- Useful for learning how doubly linked lists work under the hood

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Java 17**
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended IDE)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Riposati/DoubleLinkedListGeneratedByIATools.git
   cd DoubleLinkedListGeneratedByIATools
   ```

2. Open the project in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

3. Run `Main.java` located in the `src` folder.

> Make sure you have Java 17 or higher installed on your machine.

## 📚 Example Output

```
Adding to end: 1
Adding to end: 2
Adding to front: 0

Printing forward:
0 1 2 

Printing backward:
2 1 0 
```
